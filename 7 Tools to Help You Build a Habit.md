# 5 Tools to Help You Build a Habit

## Put Your Best Choices on Autopilot
When I say tools, you probably expect a list of 7 apps that you have to sign up for, that will magically help you build habits. Instead, I'm going to give you something much better, something that will last you a lifetime. I'm going to explain the mental models you should apply to building a habit.

> Quality is not an act, it is a habit. -Aristotle

Building and changing habits is not just a matter of willpower. In fact, the major obstacle to change is not weak will, it's a misunderstanding of how habits work.

## Understanding Habits
If we  first understand how habits work, it becomes much easier to identify, change, create and destroy habits. In other words, to use habits to your advantage.

### Habits are a 3 step loop: a reminder, a routine and a reward.

- A reminder can be the time of day - for example, bedtime for brushing your teeth - an alarm or cellphone ringer or even a changing traffic light.
- The routine is the 'non-thinking' action that you take. Examples, again, are brushing your teeth, getting out of bed, picking up the phone or driving forward.
- The reward can be positive or negative. Reinforcing or destroying the routine.

**Note**: *I prefer reminder, routine, reward (a la [James Clear](http://jamesclear.com/three-steps-habit-change)) vs. cue, routine, reward (a la Charles Duhigg) because alliteration is easier to remember, and we set reminders on our phones, not cues.*

### Why habits matter
Did you know that almost half of the things you do everyday tends to be repeated in the same location? [1].

This is not a coincidence. Habits are “autopilot” behaviors which save our energy for creative problem solving. For me personally, whether writing, coding or finding a way out of a tight submission, creative energy is how I find success. What about you?

So, realizing the value of habits is key, but it's not enough. The next step is identifying a few priorities and fashioning them into powerful levers. Interestingly, just a few certain habits can produce other positive changes. These are often labeled **keystone habits**.

For example, it’s not completely clear why. But for many people, taking time for fitness is a keystone habit that triggers widespread change.

Other keystone habits:
- Eating family meals
- Making your bed each morning
- Keeping a food journal

## Habit building tools
Trying to build a habit without tools, is like farming without tools. It's possible, but it is *touch* and horribly inefficient.

Tools are what separate us from the animals ... well, except monkeys, octopuses, crows and whole bunch of other animals, but I digress. As I wrote earlier, these tools are mental frameworks - a way of thinking about habits that make it easier to control them.

### Motivation
I've written before about different types of motivation, and how some types (intrinsic) are more sustainable than others (extrinsic). This infographic might Help

Sustainable, long term motivation needs a strong foundation and foundation is built from purpose. Figure out your life's purpose and day-to-day motivation becomes much more achievable.

### Reminder
If we're talking about saving mental energy for the important stuff, then let's reduce the effort it takes to remember to do stuff. Reminders are the first step in our habit loop, execute here and you're well on your way.

The obvious answers here are calendar reminders on your phone, but I find them imperfect. I've had too many experiences with phone reminders that I get into the habit of ignoring (pun intended). For me, reminders are most effective when they're unusual or unexpected.

Some other ideas:
- exaggerate:
- incongruity: put
- outsource: have a personal assistant, Amazon Echo or your little brother remind you of your most important habits.

Another type of reminder is a behavior chains.

### Behavior Chains
The simplest example here is brushing -> flossing. Let's say you're pretty good about brushing your teeth, but always neglect flossing (like I used to). Chain your flossing with your brushing. I love this idea - every time you brush at night, floss *just one* tooth. Hopefully, for at least 66 days. How long it takes a new habit to form can vary widely depending on the behavior, the person, and the circumstances. That said, according to a 2009 study, it took an average of 66 days for participants to form habits.

### Tracking
I mentioned 66 days in the behavior chains section. This seems to a key number for building habits. Accomplish (or avoid) something for 21 straight days and it transitions from being a to-do to a habit. Perhaps this is a self-fulfilling prophecy, because you tell yourself "once I get 66 days in a row, I've got it", but who cares? In this case a placebo is just as good as the real thing.

A fantastic example of applying tracking in real life is Jerry Seinfeld's calendar approach. According to interviewer Brad Isaac, Jerry revealed a unique calendar system he uses to track his write. Here's how it works:

> He told me to get a big wall calendar that has a whole year on one page and hang it on a prominent wall. The next step was to get a big red magic marker.

> He said for each day that I do my task of writing, I get to put a big red X over that day. "After a few days you'll have a chain. Just keep at it and the chain will grow longer every day. You'll like seeing that chain, especially when you get a few weeks under your belt. Your only job next is to not break the chain."

> "Don't break the chain," he said again for emphasis.

### Reward
Say "success" or "victory" after even minor accomplishments.
Build rewards into your behavior chains to make it more likely you'll find habit success - habitcess.

### Trouble-shooting
This is a learning concept I've been exploring with my wrestling students. When we explore specific techniques, I've always tried to tie the techniques to general principles. Lately, we've also spent time addressing common failure points. If we can identify where things typically go wrong, we can hopefully prevent or at least address these errors.

Trouble-shooting as a learning principle ties well with the Stoic exercise of pre-mortem. The basic idea behind the pre-mortem is to visualize or write down the worst possible things that can go wrong **before** moving forward with a project. There's two major benefits to the pre-mortem:

- be prepared to address things before they go wrong
- realize that the worst that can happen is real not that bad

Let's think about common failure points in habit building.

Forgetting
Not having time
Lack of willpower
