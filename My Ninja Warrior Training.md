# My Ninja Warrior Training

Tell a story...

American Ninja Warrior is a sports entertainment competition spin-off of the television series Sasuke, in which competitors try to complete a series of obstacle courses of increasing difficulty called "stages". 

So far, **no one has one the grand prize**.

The first step is identifying sub-skills

## Analyzing The Obstacles
Wikipedia, as usual, proves to be a great resource for collecting data

### [List of Sasuke Stages And Obstacles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Sasuke_stages)

[Insert pics of the Obstacle charts]


### First Stage

The first stage is primarily a test of your speed. The object is to hit a buzzer when you reach the end of the stage. The typical elimination rate is 90%. It's recently been redesigned to be much more difficult and even further reduce the number of completions. 

### Second Stage

### 

### Final Stage

The final stage (aka Mt. )

### Identified 3 major categories:

* Balance
* Grab & Swing
* Arm Traverse

### Identified Sub-Skills

* Arm Traverse
* Unstable Running
* Maintain/Control Swing Momentum
* Dynamic Gripping Strength
* Chimney Climb Movement
* Chimney Climb Catch
* Running Trampoline Jumps
* Bar Jumps
* Grip Catch Consistency

## Rules Analysis

Loved this discussion of the cultural differences between Japan and America as exemplified by the rule changes between Sasuke (the Japanese version of Ninja Warrior) and American Ninja Warrior. 

> These changes shift the overall goal from a contest of strength, an exploration of man vs. the limits of his own endurance, into a competition between men for victory.



## Conclusion

The hardest part, of course, is not in the planning but in the execution. I've found that even though I know what skills I need to train, it's been all to easy to fall back on generalized training. It's much simpler and less *uncomfortable* to spend an hour climbing vs. spending 20 minutes working on pinch grip strength and 30 minutes on chimney catches.
