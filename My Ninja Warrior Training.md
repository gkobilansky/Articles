Learn How I Found The X Most Important Skills For Ninja Warrior And How You Can Use My Approach To Train For Any Competition

subtitle:
What's the point of learning and teaching about optimal performance if you don't put it into daily practice? Here's why I kicked myself just when I thought my training was going so well ...

Getting prepared for your most important performance doesn't feel good. 

Or at least it shouldn't. 

You should make yourself uncomfortable. You must become at peace with being uncomfortable. 

>We cannot calculate our important contests, adventures, and great loves to the end. The only thing we can really count on is getting surprised. No matter how much preparation we do, in the real tests of our lives, we'll be in unfamiliar terrain. - [Josh Waitzkin](http://amzn.to/1LbfGrF)

But, right after submitting my audition video for American Ninja Warrior (below), I realized I wasn't *making myself uncomfortable*.

American Ninja Warrior is a sports entertainment competition spin-off of the television series Sasuke, in which competitors try to complete a series of obstacle courses of increasing difficulty called "stages". 

So far, **no one has won the grand prize**.

The first step is identifying sub-skills

## Analyzing The Obstacles
Wikipedia, as usual, proves to be a great resource for collecting data

### [List of Sasuke Stages And Obstacles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Sasuke_stages)

[Insert pics of the Obstacle charts]


### First Stage
The First Stage is primarily a test of your speed. The object is to hit a buzzer when you reach the end of the stage. The typical elimination rate is 90. This stage has recently been redesigned to be much more difficult, to even further reduce the number of completions. 

#### Obstacle Breakdown


### Second Stage
Only superficially different from the First Stage, the Second Stage is more of the grueling same. I'd say the Second Stage is more of a test of strength and flexibility compared to the first, espcially considering obstacles like the Swap Salmon Ladder, the Wall Lift and the Spider Walk,r espectivley.

### Third Stage
The Third Stage is a test of 2 things upper body stamina (especially grip stamina) and mental fortitude. There is no time limit, it's just you versus your physical limits.

According to Wikipedia:

>The Third Stage is so grueling that, on average, someone passes it only every other competition. Only 22 individuals have ever passed it, and only four have passed it more than once.

### Final Stage
The final stage (aka Mount Midoriyama) is a straight shot up with a time limit of 30-45 seconds. This stage has changed 6 times, starting with a vanilla rope climb and recently was changed to 

Typically, only one or two people make it to the Final Stage, if any make it at all.

So that's a nice overview of the stages and all, but what I really care about are the obstacles. Sure, each stage has a different broad focus, but obstacle types can repeat across stages with little to no pattern. Just because stage two has more strenght obstacles than stage one, doesn't mean you won't have to run over a rolling log at any point.  

Plus, we want to get good at Ninja Warrior, not just a particular stage. So we have to [break the total contest down to subskills](http://flowathletics.com/3-steps-to-be-awesome-at-any-skill/). The first step is to organize the obstacles in a way that made sense to me.

I had my virtual assistant put together a spreadsheet listing every obstacle, the number of times it was used and a brief description copied from Wikipedia.

[insert pic & link to spreadsheet (collect email?)]

This listing made it much easier for me to break the total collection into a much more manegable listing of major categories:

* Jumping Dexterity
* Grab & Swing
* Arm Traverse

<<<<<<< HEAD
Using these categories and my qualitative analysis of the individual obstacle descriptions, with help from all the time I've spent watching Ninja Warrior videos, I started breaking the major categories into simpler to train sub-skills. 

The final goal here is to identify 5-10 of the most important sub-skill. Even this list can be broken down further, but here's the point:

> The level you are trying to get to is where you can practice efficiently and measure improvement quickly

That being said, here are **the most important Ninja Warrior sub-skills** I've identified based on my analysis of previous obstacles and categories.

### Indentified Sub-Skills

### Identified Sub-Skills
>>>>>>> FETCH_HEAD

* Arm Traverse
* Unstable Running
* Maintain/Control Swing Momentum
* Dynamic Gripping Strength
* Chimney Climb Movement
* Chimney Climb Catch
* Running Trampoline Jumps
* Bar Jumps
* Grip Catch Consistency

In my next post, I'll explore simple training exersices we can incorporate to effectivley train each sub-skill. Wish me luck, because I have no idea what we'll do for the chimney climb catch.

## Rules Analysis

Loved this discussion of the cultural differences between Japan and America as exemplified by the rule changes between Sasuke (the Japanese version of Ninja Warrior) and American Ninja Warrior. 

> These changes shift the overall goal from a contest of strength, an exploration of man vs. the limits of his own endurance, into a competition between men for victory.



## Conclusion

The hardest part, of course, is not in the planning but in the execution. I've found that even though I know what skills I need to train, it's been all to easy to fall back on generalized training. It's much simpler and less *uncomfortable* to spend an hour climbing vs. spending 20 minutes working on pinch grip strength and 30 minutes on chimney catches.
