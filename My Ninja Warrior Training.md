Learn How I Found The X Most Important Skills For Ninja Warrior And How You Can Use My Approach To Train For Any Competition

subtitle:
What's the point of learning and teaching about optimal performance if you don't put it into daily practice? Here's why I kicked myself just when I thought my training was going so well ...

Getting prepared for your most important performance doesn't feel good. 

Or at least it shouldn't. 

You should make yourself uncomfortable. You must become at peace with being uncomfortable. 

>We cannot calculate our important contests, adventures, and great loves to the end. The only thing we can really count on is getting surprised. No matter how much preparation we do, in the real tests of our lives, we'll be in unfamiliar terrain. - [Josh Waitzkin](http://amzn.to/1LbfGrF)

But, right after submitting my audition video for American Ninja Warrior (below), I realized I wasn't *making myself uncomfortable*. My training has been focused on a few things I enjoy - bouldering, wrestling and muay thai. Sure,  bouldering is fantastic for grip strength, plus wrestling and muay thai help me build cardio, flexibility and balance.

This type of training approach is very broad, however. I realized, I'm not focused enough. I'm not following my own advice on [how to be awesome at any skill](http://flowathletics.com/3-steps-to-be-awesome-at-any-skill/. Specifically, I haven't broken American Ninja Warrior down into sub-skills, so I can *practice efficiently and measure improvements quickly*.

## About ANW

American Ninja Warrior is a sports entertainment competition spin-off of the television series Sasuke, in which competitors try to complete a series of obstacle courses of increasing difficulty called "stages". 

So far, **no one has won the grand prize**.

## Rules Analysis

In my research on the AWN obstacles, I found this fantastic discussion on the cultural differences between Japan and America as exemplified by the [rule changes between Sasuke (the Japanese version of Ninja Warrior) and American Ninja Warrior](http://therulesonthefield.com/2012/06/04/comparative-analysis-ninja-warrior/). 

> These changes shift the overall goal from a contest of strength, an exploration of man vs. the limits of his own endurance, into a competition between men for victory.

### Analyzing The Obstacles
Wikipedia, as usual, proves to be a great resource for collecting data. Here is the [List of Sasuke Stages And Obstacles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Sasuke_stages)

[Insert pics of the Obstacle charts]


#### First Stage
The First Stage is primarily a test of your speed. The object is to hit a buzzer when you reach the end of the stage. The typical elimination rate is 90. This stage has recently been redesigned to be much more difficult, to even further reduce the number of completions. 

### Second Stage
Only superficially different from the First Stage, the Second Stage is more of the grueling same. I'd say the Second Stage is more of a test of strength and flexibility compared to the first, especially considering obstacles like the Swap Salmon Ladder, the Wall Lift and the Spider Walk, respectively.

### Third Stage
The Third Stage is a test of 2 things upper body stamina (especially grip stamina) and mental fortitude. There is no time limit, it's just you versus your physical limits.

According to Wikipedia:

>The Third Stage is so grueling that, on average, someone passes it only every other competition. Only 22 individuals have ever passed it, and only four have passed it more than once.

### Final Stage
The final stage (aka Mount Midoriyama) is a straight shot up with a time limit of 30-45 seconds. This stage has changed 6 times, starting with a vanilla rope climb and recently was changed to 

Typically, only one or two people make it to the Final Stage, if any make it at all.

So that's a nice overview of the stages and all, but what I really care about are the obstacles. Sure, each stage has a different broad focus, but obstacle types can repeat across stages with little to no pattern. Just because stage two has more strength obstacles than stage one, doesn't mean you won't have to run over a rolling log at any point.  

Plus, we want to get good at Ninja Warrior, not just a particular stage. So we have to [break the total contest down to sub-skills](http://flowathletics.com/3-steps-to-be-awesome-at-any-skill/). The first step is to organize the obstacles in a way that made sense to me.

I had my virtual assistant put together a spreadsheet listing every obstacle, the number of times it was used and a brief description copied from Wikipedia.

[insert pic & link to spreadsheet (collect email?)]

This listing made it much easier for me to break the total collection into a much more manageable listing of major categories:

* Jumping Dexterity
* Grab & Swing
* Arm Traverse

Using these categories and my qualitative analysis of the individual obstacle descriptions, with help from all the time I've spent watching Ninja Warrior videos, I started breaking the major categories into simpler to train sub-skills. 

The final goal here is to identify 5-10 of the most important sub-skill. Even this list can be broken down further, but here's the point:

> The level you are trying to get to is where you can practice efficiently and measure improvement quickly

That being said, here are, in my opinion, **the most important Ninja Warrior sub-skills**.

### Identified Sub-Skills
* Arm Traverse - moving from one location to another using just, or mainly, your arms. **Example obstacles:** Delta Bridge/Grip Hang, Swing Ladder, Unstable Bridge, Arm Rings, Rumbling Dice, Spider Flip.
* Unstable Running/Jumping - Running or jumping while maintaining your balance on an unstable surface. **Example obstacles:** Barrel Climb, Quintuple Step, Prism See-Saw, Cone Jump, Hurdle Jump, Dome Steps, etc.
* Maintain/Control Swing Momentum - Similar skill to the arm traverse, but here we focus more on maintaining our grip while making sure your swing takes you where you need to go. **Example obstacles:** 
* Dynamic Gripping Strength
* Chimney Climb Movement - Once you are wedged between two parallel walls, being able to move around without falling is key to many obstacles. **Example obstacles:** Spider Walk, Spider Climb, Body Prop, Spider Jump.
* Chimney Climb Catch - Not a lot of obstacle here, but the one that trips everyone up - **the dreaded Jumping Spider**. You have to jump from a trampoline into a shaft of parallel walls 5ft apart and catch yourself there by wedging your feet and arms between the walls. This obstacle trips so many people up that, that I'm dedicating special focus to it. One key to success will be flexibility - my side-split is barely at the 5ft mark. I'll need to get it to at least 5'6" to be comfortable here. 
* Running Trampoline Jumps - many ANW competitors neglect this sub-skill. But hitting that trampoline just right is key in many obstacles. **Example obstacles:** Jumping Spider (of course), Reverse Fly, Jump Hang.
* Bar Movement - Holding a bar (or something similar) and using your bodyweight to move it. **Example obstacles:** Salmon ladder, Rumbling Dice, Propeller Bars, Swing Ladder.
* Grip Catch Consistency - 

In my next post, I'll explore simple training exercises we can incorporate to effectively train each sub-skill. Wish me luck, because I have no idea what we'll do for the chimney climb catch.

## Conclusion

The hardest part, of course, is not in the planning but in the execution. I've found that even though I know what skills I need to train, it's been all to easy to fall back on generalized training. It's much simpler and less *uncomfortable* to spend an hour climbing vs. spending 20 minutes working on pinch grip strength and 30 minutes on chimney catches.
