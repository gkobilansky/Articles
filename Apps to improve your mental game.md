"Why won't you type 'T'?"

"What is this weird 'Service Message Not Found' thing that's popping up?"

"I'm this close to throwing my phone against the wall and buying a new one."

Luckily, my friend Logan Lo convinced me otherwise. Instead, I wiped my phone, got rid of all the apps and reinstalled the operating system (for you tech geeks out there, I actually installed [Cyanogenmod](http://www.cyanogenmod.org/)).

It was a breath of fresh air. My 3 year old Galaxy S3 is smooth as butter again. But, a bunch of the apps I used daily were gone. Time to reinstall 'em:

* Reddit
* Instagram
* Facebook
* Snapchat 

...

Wait a second. These apps are all the same: press to launch, use thumb scroll, turn brain off.

Sure, they can be nice to see what the rest of the world is up to or and it's good to turn off every once in a while. But we can do better.

Let's take a look at some apps we can actively use for growth and self-improvement. Apps we can use to enhance our mindset, optimize our nutrition, track our fitness and fine-tune technique.

Just a quick note - I use these apps on Android, but I included links to the same or similar apps on iPhone where I could find them.

Without further ado, here's a list of my favorite apps for stepping up your mental game:

## Evernote

Create notebooks and notes. I keep ... 

With the Search features I can find most notes easily by typing in a vague description.

## Trello Boards

Trello boards are fantastic for lists. On each board you create multiple lists and to each list you add as many cards (basically, virtual post-it notes) as you want. 

Each person you invite, can access the board you invite her to, but not any of the other boards you own. You can make each board public or private.

I love to use Trello Boards to keep to track of goals,. You can also use Trello to make and share travel plans,

## Headspace

The Headspace.com byline goes something like this:

> Headspace is meditation made simple. Learn online, when you want, wherever you are, in just 10 minutes a day.

If you haven't heard me preach on about meditation, then you haven't looked around. Don't just take my word for it thought.

## Google Calendar
Diet and nutrition. Notification reminder to drink a bunch of water when I first wake up and to take my supplements. 

I forget my Vitamin D more often than I remembered it. But since setting a daily, re-occurring Google Calendar event titled "Drink Water & Take Supplements" that goes off in the morning, I've been able to build a habit

## IF and DO
Remember the iconic black turtleneck and jeans of Steve Jobs? There's a reason he wore that outfit every day. It was to eliminate all the little decisions (like picking what clothes to wear) that aren't a part of his focus.

IF helps you automate the electronic versions of those decisions. This background automation is accomplished with recipes. IF is dependent on a simple phrase: if this then that. Sample IF recipe:

(Yes, I see the irony of showing a automation example with Instagram, when I started this post with a rant against Instagram. Just checking to see if you're paying attention.)

IF is made by IFTTT, a company that gives you control and automates your "electronic life".

## Fancy Hands
Another option for offloading the tasks that don't add value to your personal mission. 

The more time you have to focus on the 4 pillars of mindset, fitness, technique and nutrition, the faster your performance will improve. 

Use my [Fancy Hands referrall](http://fncy.it/19PVAFy) link for half off your first month. Ripped right off the site, here's what's best about fancy hands:

* We’re more friendly than a fist bump
* We’re more dependable than a handshake
* We’ll tackle any task you can imagine, within the bounds of science and the law
* We’re smoother than Bill Withers' “[Grandma’s Hands](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv5pagal-ls)”

### Brain N-Back

This one's intense! Brain N-Back by Philip Nguyen is one mobile version of what are generally called Dual N-Back games.

I'm sure you've heard how video games improve hand-eye coordination. In fact, they're a much better activity than passively watching TV, but dual n-back is on another level. 

It's similar to the old memory games, where you have to match 2 cards in random locations. But dual n-back is orders of magnitude more difficult you have to remember both location and sound "n" steps back. Because you have to remember both audio and visual cues, it can kinda feel like your brain is being pulled into 2 different directions.

Dual N-Back are the only games that have been shown to improve working memory and fluid intelligence, which are crucial for your personal and professional success. It's basically the only "game" scientifically shown to raise your IQ. 

It's not easy, but then again, easy workouts don't help us get better!
