>Man, I really wish I'd gotten into wrestling in high-school.

Wrestling is the #6 high-school sport in America, right below soccer. It's more popular than cross country, swimming or golf. But almost every time I'm at the gym - rolling with the BJJ guys or training with Nak Muay or talking to people interested in MMA, I still hear the same sentiment.

I think there's been a resurgance in the popularity of wrestling due to us wrestlers finding so much success in the UFC. 5 out of the 8 current champs are former wrestlers.

So this post is for that guy or girl that never wrestled in highschool or maybe you wrestled for a little at the youth level and now that you're training again, you want to give it a shot.

This post is ment as a *very basic* overview of the technical principles of wrestling - focusing specifically on the standing position.

The benefits of wrestling are many:

- It's universal - every culture has their own form of wrestling
- Anybody can wrestle - tall, short ... heck, even [missing limbs don't hold wrestlers back](http://kyle-maynard.com/).
- Self confidence
- Discipline
- Mental toughness - more than any other sport 
- Fitness
- Self defense

## The Basics
The first thing I try to teach beginner wrestlers is a deep understanding of the basics. There are a ton of fancy moves I could teach, in fact I love teaching cool looking moves - but that's not what wins fights. Cool moves are fun, but usually you have break basic position in order to accomplish them. And I firmly believe:

>You have to know the rules before you can break them.

### Position (aka Stance)
The hardest part of any sport, I believe, is staying in good position once the action gets going. In most cases, if you are able to keep your body in a position of strength and athletisism, in the middle of the storm, you'll exist the other side victorious.

If you take a look at a *most* sports, you'll notice a common theme in terms of "proper" position:

- Legs at shoulder width or more apart
- Knees bent
- Weight balanced between your feet
- Elbows tight to your body (execeptions to this rule are more common)

Look at a boxers stance for example and then take a look at a football middle-linebacker or a baseball player swigning a bat and you'll notice these positions repeating themselves over and over. I like to use the example of a powerlifter squating - obviously he takes this postion so can lift the most weight, be as powerful as possible. So we want to have the same position in wrestling.

## Basic Movements
As I said before, it's important to maintain your position not just at the start of the match, but as the action gets going. These videos will show you how to move from a good stance to a good attack while maintaining position.

#### Leg Attacks
Here are two basic ways to enter a wrestling style leg attack - the plunge step and the drop step.

In the next video, I show how to take these movements and drill them on your own. Getting these two movements figured out before your first wrestling class will give you a huge leg up when starting out. I've been wrestling for over 17 years and I still practice the plunge step and drop step every day.

Another way to train your basic leg attack movements. This time with a heavy bag.

Sometimes your initial leg attack fails. But one of the keys to becoming a successful wrestler is persistance. That's where the knee slide, our next basic movement, is a huge help.

Of course, it might be preferable to get out of the way of your opponent, so you don't have to resort to the knee slide. The sweep single is getting a bit advanced in terms of movement coordination, but it's still worthwhile practicing early in your wrestling career.

#### Upper Body Attacks
Upper body attacks can take a few different forms, the main being throws and what's known as "short offense". Although throws look really cool, I don't recommend them for begginners. It's just too easy to screw them up, end up falling on your own head and have your opponent fall on top of you.

So, let's take a look at some short offense - the front headlock

Then, once you have the front headlock, you still want to be able to get behind your opponent.

Here's a sneakier way for you to get the front headlock while fighting in an upper body position.

### Conditioning

One of your biggest strengths as a wrestler is going to be your conditioning. I'll leave you with a great way to incorporate the skills you've learned so far into a conditioning drill.
