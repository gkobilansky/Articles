## Outline

- Product-Market fit
    + When I think about products, I ask the question "is this solving a problem in the market?"
    + Even if yes, is this a problem the market knows about
    + If not, you first have to educate your customers about the problem, convince them it's a problem that needs solving and then show how your product is the right solution for that problem
    + Sounds hard? That's because it is. This takes a lot of resources, 
- I love working with athletes, especially combat athletes, but I don't love working with physical products, especially supplements
    + Maybe you've heard the phrase "content is king". We're in the information edge and information is the truly valuable. 
    + Meanwhile, customers are looking down on supplements. Unfortunately, the snake-oil salesman is still alive and well in our industry. It's an uphill battle to convince people that you are selling something that works and not a well-polished turd.
    + Plus, working with physical products means you have to figure out shipping, inventory and all sorts of other logistics that just aren't that much fun for me to worry about. 
- We went through the last production run, I just have a few bottles left. The financial results from the last run, don't justify investment in a new run.
    + It was nice getting big payouts when I had a fire sale through BJJHq and a steady stream of income through website and amazon sales
    + But at the end of the day, the return on time and money I spent marketing Flow just doesn't justify another investment at this point.
- Focus
    + This decision will allow me to focus again on creating great content for our flow family and for new readers and followers.

Some of the other things I'm working on:
- coaching at Unity BJJ (working with Miyao bros on their takedowns)
- cranking out better and better wrestling instructionals
- preparing for a speech / seminar in Brazil
- coding and building websites
- and on a note completely unrelated to Flow Athletics - wealthbot.io



# Why I'm Discontinuing Flow

> Quote on how failure is just a stepping stone

As of about an hour ago, it's no longer possible to buy Flow on flowathletics.com. 

If you come to Flow Athletics for the content on fitness, nutrition, mindset and technique (combat sport, mainly, right?) and don't know about Flow Neural Enhancer, you can still read about it on the sales page. There's just no more buy button.

Then again you might have noticed, I've slowed down on putting up cool, interesting new content too. That's my bad and I'll get into a little bit of the why. 

First of all, it's important for me to say, I don't look at the discontinuation of a product as a failure. From the beginning, Flow was a bootstrapped enterprise. It was my first (good) idea for launching a business, or at least the only idea I had the balls to take a risk on. 

I left a cushy corporate gig with not too much savings and no entrepreneurial experience to speak of. I'd been reading books like Four Hour Work Week, The E-Myth Revisited and all the best blog posts I could get my hands on. But that's no substitute for real action. 

The idea for Flow appealed to me for a few reasons. 

It solved my own problem.

I was going to work in a niche that I loved.

The idea was unique enough to help me stand out.

But, fatally, I forgot to consider one thing: was Flow solving a problem that my customers knew they had? Currently, I think the answer to that question is a big resounding NO. Most people don't know that being in the zone is a real state, even fewer know that that state is called flow, and least of all know the value of attaining flow as much as possible.

That doesn't mean there's no opportunity for the answer to change. With projects like:

* The Flow Genome Project
* The Rise of Superman
XXXXX
Flow: XXXX

coming out in the last few years, I think more and more everyday athletes are beginning to realize the importance of flow to their training process as well as the elite, competitive process.

But back to today. Today educating my potential customers (you) about flow, why you should care about flow, what do to get into flow and finally, how Flow Neural Enhance can help support you efforts is an uphill battle. A battle that's tough to win with a zero dollar marketing budget and a small part-time team. 

## What's next

Expect more great content:

- how to stay on the ball when eating healthy
- tools for finding flow
- the importance of resilience
- more [book reviews](https://flowathletics.com/obstacle-way-motivation-book-review/)
- new site design - the site's been feeling a bit bland lately. The new design will be just as content focused as the site is today, but I think we could use a refresher. Plus I want to tighten up some design elements that just plain look ugly to me 

## Wrapping up

This post has been a long time coming. I'd like to apologize to anyone that's been inconvenienced or disappointed by my lack of online activity. Flow's been my baby for a few years now, and this decision was not an easy one to make. But it was even harder to put down in writing - the finality of this announcement caused me to push it back week after week.

For the present time, you can still get [Flow on Amazon](https://flowathletics.com/obstacle-way-motivation-book-review/), but stock is limited, so act fast.

I'd love to hear from you in the comments of this post, via email (gene at flowathletics.com) or on social media:

Hi Yanelisa,

First of all, I want to thank you for being such a great customer. I really appreciate your continued support. Thanks!

With apprehension, I have to tell you that in a few minutes your subscription to Flow will be deactivated. I'm sorry to do this, but I have to. Flow Athletics will no longer be selling Flow. It's been a good run, but I've decided to take the project in a different direction.

Going forward I believe team flow will best be served with a focus on great content in fitness, nutrition, mindset and technique.

Then again you might have noticed, I've slowed down on putting up cool, interesting, new content too. That's my bad; this was a hard decision to make and the process stifled my output. 

But, going forward I'm excited by a renewed focus, a fresh outlook and a deeper look into optimal performance.  

Hoping you'll stay in touch.

Practice Perfect,
- Gene

PS I do really want to apologize if you've been inconvenienced or disappointed by our lack of online activity. Flow's been my baby for a few years now, and this decision was not an easy one to make.
